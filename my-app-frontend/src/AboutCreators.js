          <div className="description">"My work explores the relationship between new class identities and unwanted gifts. With influences as diverse as Kierkegaard and Roy Lichtenstein, new variations are synthesised from both opaque and transparent discourse. Ever since I was a pre-adolescent I have been fascinated by the traditional understanding of the universe. What starts out as yearning soon becomes corroded into a cacophony of greed, leaving only a sense of what could have been and the unlikelihood of a new reality. As temporal phenomena become reconfigured through diligent and diverse practice, the viewer is left with a testament to the limits of our existence."</div>

          <div className="description">"My work explores the relationship between consumerist fetishism and emotional memories. With influences as diverse as Camus and Joni Mitchell, new insights are synthesised from both orderly and random discourse. Ever since I was a student I have been fascinated by the ephemeral nature of meaning. What starts out as contemplation soon becomes corrupted into a manifesto of distress, leaving only a sense of unreality and the possibility of a new understanding. As momentary phenomena become distorted through frantic and critical practice, the viewer is left with a tribute to the limits of our condition."</div>

          <div className="description">"My work explores the relationship between the body and UFO sightings. With influences as diverse as Blake and Francis Bacon, new synergies are synthesised from both opaque and transparent meanings. Ever since I was a teenager I have been fascinated by the theoretical limits of relationships. What starts out as yearning soon becomes corroded into a hegemony of temptation, leaving only a sense of dread and the dawn of a new understanding. As subtle derivatives become frozen through diligent and personal practice, the viewer is left with a hymn to the outposts of our culture."</div>
